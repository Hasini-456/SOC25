Most of the theory I read during these 4â€“5 weeks was already familiar to me from my DSA course.
However, this project helped me revise the topics in a more structured, topic-wise manner, which gave me better clarity.

In each topic, I improved my coding skills, learned more efficient approaches, and discovered new techniques for implementation.

For some problems, even when I had the correct logical idea, I struggled to implement it in code. 
In such cases, I referred to online solutions, which helped me understand and learn the correct approach.

While I already knew most of the theoretical concepts, this SOC project significantly helped me enhance my coding efficiency and practical skills
